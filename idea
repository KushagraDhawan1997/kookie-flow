Kookie Flow
A WebGL-native node graph library. React Flow's ergonomics, but GPU-rendered for performance at scale.
Core insight: React Flow struggles not because of node count, but because each node is 20+ DOM elements, each edge is SVG path recalculation, and React reconciles thousands of components on every pan/zoom.
Architecture:

WebGL canvas for edges, grid, minimap, selection, node containers
Optional DOM overlay for custom node content (hybrid mode)
Pure WebGL primitives for visual nodes (images as textures, 3D mesh previews in same context)

Three tiers:

Visual nodes — fully WebGL, optimized for AI/3D tools (image outputs, mesh viewers, no DOM)
Hybrid nodes — WebGL container, DOM portal for custom React content
DOM escape hatch — full flexibility when needed

Differentiator: First-class support for visual output previews. 3D mesh viewers live in the same WebGL context—no separate canvas per node. Image previews are textures, not img elements.
Target users: AI workflow tools, geometry/shader node editors, creative tools where preview performance matters.
Open source (MIT). The moat is design quality and architecture, not the code.
